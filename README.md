# QueueSDP
[![View notebooks](https://wolfr.am/HAAhzkRq)](https://wolfr.am/TPaqP8aH)

A wolfram language package for applications of semi-definite programming in queuing theory.

**Components:**
- [x] `DistributionMomentTruncation`: represent truncated moment sequences upon which the [moment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_problem) can be raised.
- [ ] `ProcessMomentTruncation`: represent truncated moment (including auto-correlating joints) sequences of (weakly-)steady processes.
- [ ] `QueueMomentTruncation`: represent truncated moment sequences of queues, suitable for the use in semi-definite probramming.
- [ ] _(possibly) `ProcessMomentTruncation`: truncated moment sequences of **general** processes._
